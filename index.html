<b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy <em>text </em> of the printing and typesetting industry.
<p></p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b><i>has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s</mark>  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book</i>
<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the  <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software <del>like Aldus PageMaker</del> including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
